Common Applications includes : </br>
* Customer Feedback Analysis
* Social Media Monitoring
* Opinion Mining

Machine learning models, deep learning techniques, or pre-trained APIs like GCP Natural Language API can be used for sentiment analysis. </br>
We will be looking at GCP Natural Language API approach for Sentiment Analysis.

## GCP Natural Language API
The Google Cloud Natural Language API is a cloud-based service that helps developers analyze and interpret text using machine learning. It offers various NLP features, including: </br>
* **Sentiment Analysis** – Evaluates whether the text conveys a positive, negative, or neutral emotion.
* **Entity Recognition** – Detects and categorizes key entities such as names, places, and dates.
* **Syntax Analysis** – Examines sentence structure, grammar, and parts of speech.
